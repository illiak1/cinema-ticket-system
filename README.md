## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Database Configuration

1. Create a MySQL database named `cinema_db`.
2. Import the SQL schema from: `database_dump/cinema_database_dump.sql`
3. Update the database credentials in: `src/cinema/database/DatabaseConnection.java`


   ```java
   private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cinema_db";
   private static final String USER = "your_username";
   private static final String PASS = "your_password";
   ```

### 2. Image Assets

* Place movie posters in an `images/` folder at the root of the project.
* Ensure filenames match the `image_path` column in your `movies` database table.

### 3. Execution

Compile and run the project using your IDE or via CLI:

```bash
# Run the main entry point
java cinema.auth.LoginForm
```

---

## 🖥️ Key UI Components

### **Login**

The system starts with a modern login screen, where users can either log in with their existing credentials or register as a new user. The `LoginForm` class provides an authentication interface, using `UserSession` to track the logged-in user's ID. This ensures that tickets are linked to the correct account, allowing users to manage their bookings and profile information.

The **LoginForm** uses:

* **Input validation** to ensure proper email format and that fields are not left empty.
* **Error handling** with custom messages if the user credentials are invalid.

---

### **Registration & Password Management**

#### **User Registration (`RegistrationForm`)**

New users can create an account through a dedicated registration form. The system ensures:

* **Validated input fields** (email format, full name, password requirements)
* **Password confirmation check** to prevent mismatches
* **Minimum password length enforcement**
* Automatic insertion of user data into the database with a default role (`USER`)

After successful registration, users are redirected to the login screen.

#### **Change Password (`ChangePasswordForm`)**

Authenticated users can securely update their password by providing:

* Their **registered email**
* **Current password** (for verification)
* A **new password** with confirmation

The system performs:

* **Credential verification** against stored data
* **Validation checks** (non-empty fields, password length, match confirmation)
* **Database update** only if the current password is correct

Upon success, the user is redirected back to the login screen.

### **Movies Dashboard (MovieListingPage)**

The Movie Dashboard displays all available movies in a card-based layout.
Each movie shows its poster, title, duration, rating, and release date.
Users can click on a movie to view available showtimes.

### **View Showtimes Screen (WatchShowtimesPage)**

The View Showtimes screen displays all available screening times for a selected movie.
Each showtime shows the start time, hall number, and ticket price.
Users can select a showtime to proceed to seat selection.

### **Seat Selection Screen (SeatSelectionPage)**

In the **Seat Selection** screen, users can:

* View the seating layout for a selected movie/showtime.
* **Select seats** and visually see which seats are taken and which are available.
* The seat selection updates in real-time, ensuring a smooth booking process.

### **Booking Confirmation Screen (BookingConfirmationPage)**

Once the user selects their seats, they are directed to a **Booking Confirmation** page where they can review their selection before confirming the booking.

### **Users Panel Screen**

The admin panel provides a dedicated Users management interface (UsersPanel) where administrators can:
* **View user details** and manage them (Create, Read, Update, Delete - CRUD).
* **Edit user information** like name, email, password, and role (admin, user).

### 🔄 System Flow

Login → Movie Dashboard → Showtimes Selection → Seat Selection → Booking Confirmation

## 📂 DAO (Data Access Object)

The **DAO layer** serves as the intermediary between the application logic and the database, encapsulating all CRUD operations for the entities in the system (e.g., **User**, **Movie**, **Showtime**, **Seat**, **Booking**). By using DAO, we achieve separation of concerns, making the application more maintainable and testable.

### 🧑‍💻 DAO Classes

The following DAO classes are implemented in the project:

- **UserDAO**: Manages user-related operations (e.g., registration, login, updates).
- **MovieDAO**: Handles movie-related operations (e.g., adding, fetching, updating movies).
- **SeatDAO**: Manages seat availability and booking status.
- **ShowtimeDAO**: Deals with movie showtimes (e.g., adding, updating, and fetching showtimes).
- **BookingDAO**: Handles ticket booking operations.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Email Notifications**: Implement email notifications to notify users of successful bookings or cancellations, potentially integrating an email service like **SendGrid** or **Amazon SES**.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrate a payment gateway (like **Stripe** or **PayPal**) to handle ticket payments, allowing users to pay for their bookings directly from the system.
- **Search & Filter**: Add search functionality so users can easily search for movies by title, genre, or release date. A filter for available showtimes and ticket prices could also be helpful.
- **Security Improvements**: Implement **password hashing** (e.g., using **bcrypt**) to store user passwords securely. Consider adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
